# 🌱 My Web Development Journey  

Hi there! This repository is a personal log of my journey as I learn **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and everything about **Web Development**.  

I’m using this space to:  
Stay consistent, 
Document what I learn,  
Build and share small projects along the way;  

This is *not* about being perfect—it’s about growing step by step 🚀
