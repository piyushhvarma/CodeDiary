    "Budget and Budgetary Control involve planning and controlling financial resources to meet short-term and long-term goals. "
    "Budgeting helps individuals, businesses, and governments allocate their income to various spending categories, maintain savings, and avoid deficits.\n\n"
    "Fixed Budgets are rigid and predetermined, ideal for predictable financial situations, offering simplicity and strong control. In contrast, Flexible Budgets adjust "
    "with real-time data like production levels, making them more suitable for variable environments.\n\n"
    "The Incremental Budgeting method uses last year‚Äôs budget as a base, making small adjustments. While quick and easy, it may perpetuate inefficiencies. "
    "Zero-Based Budgeting (ZBB) resets the budget every cycle, requiring all expenses to be justified from scratch‚Äîgood for transparency but resource-intensive.\n\n"
    "Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB) emphasizes budgeting based on specific operations or activities, ideal for identifying cost drivers in production. "
    "Performance-Based Budgeting (PBB) ties funds to performance metrics, encouraging efficiency and results-based funding‚Äîoften seen in the public sector.\n\n"
    "Finally, Rolling Budgets keep the financial plan dynamic by continuously adding new periods, making it a flexible approach to budgeting."
